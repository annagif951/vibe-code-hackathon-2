            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The muscular system consists of <strong>over 600 muscles</strong> that facilitate movement, maintain posture, and regulate essential functions like blood circulation.</p>
            <p>Muscles work in coordination with the skeletal and nervous systems to produce voluntary and involuntary movements. They also play a role in maintaining body temperature through heat generation during contraction.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Types of Muscle Tissue</h2>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Skeletal Muscle:</strong> Voluntary muscles attached to bones, enabling movement. These muscles are striated and can be consciously controlled.</li>
            <li><strong>Cardiac Muscle:</strong> Involuntary muscle found only in the heart, responsible for pumping blood. Cardiac muscle cells are branched and interconnected for synchronized contractions.</li>
            <li><strong>Smooth Muscle:</strong> Involuntary muscles lining the organs, controlling functions like digestion, blood vessel constriction, and respiration. These muscles are non-striated and work automatically.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each muscle type has unique structural and functional properties suited to its role in the body.</p>

            <h2>Muscle Contraction & Physiology</h2>
            <p>Muscles contract via the <strong>sliding filament theory</strong>, where <strong>actin</strong> and <strong>myosin</strong> proteins interact. During contraction, myosin heads bind to actin filaments and pull them inward, shortening the muscle fiber.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate):</strong> Powers muscle contractions by providing energy for myosin head movement and detachment.</li>
                <li><strong>Calcium Ions:</strong> Released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, they enable actin-myosin binding by exposing binding sites on actin.</li>
                <li><strong>Neuromuscular Junction:</strong> The synapse where a motor neuron communicates with a muscle fiber, triggering contraction via neurotransmitters like acetylcholine.</li>
                <li><strong>Sarcomere:</strong> The basic contractile unit of muscle fiber, composed of repeating actin and myosin filaments.</li>
                <li><strong>Muscle Fatigue:</strong> Occurs when muscles lose the ability to contract efficiently, often due to depletion of ATP or accumulation of lactic acid.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Muscle contraction is a highly regulated process involving electrical signals, chemical messengers, and structural proteins working together to produce movement.</p>

            <h2>Muscle Groups & Functions</h2>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Flexors:</strong> Decrease joint angles (e.g., biceps brachii bends the elbow).</li>
            <li><strong>Extensors:</strong> Increase joint angles (e.g., triceps brachii straightens the elbow).</li>
            <li><strong>Abductors:</strong> Move limbs <strong>away</strong> from the midline (e.g., deltoid raises the arm sideways).</li>
            <li><strong>Adductors:</strong> Move limbs <strong>toward</strong> the midline (e.g., adductor longus brings the thigh inward).</li>
            <li><strong>Rotators:</strong> Rotate a bone around its axis (e.g., rotator cuff muscles in the shoulder).</li>
            <li><strong>Levators:</strong> Lift a body part (e.g., levator scapulae elevates the scapula).</li>
            <li><strong>Depressors:</strong> Lower a body part (e.g., depressor anguli oris lowers the corners of the mouth).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Major muscle groups include the <strong>pectorals</strong> (chest), <strong>latissimus dorsi</strong> (back), <strong>quadriceps</strong> (front thigh), <strong>hamstrings</strong> (back thigh), <strong>gastrocnemius</strong> (calf), and <strong>gluteals</strong> (buttocks). Each group works together to enable complex movements and maintain stability.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Muscle Disorders</h2>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Muscular Dystrophy:</strong> Genetic condition leading to progressive muscle weakening and loss of muscle mass. Different types affect various muscle groups and can impact mobility and heart function.</li>
            <li><strong>Myasthenia Gravis:</strong> Autoimmune disorder causing muscle fatigue and weakness, especially after periods of activity. It often affects muscles controlling the eyes, face, and swallowing.</li>
            <li><strong>Muscle Strains:</strong> Damage from overstretching or tearing muscle fibers, commonly caused by excessive physical activity or improper lifting techniques. Symptoms include pain, swelling, and limited movement.</li>
            <li><strong>Cramping:</strong> Sudden, involuntary muscle contractions that can be painful. Causes include dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, or prolonged exercise.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you experience persistent muscle weakness, pain, or cramps, consult a healthcare professional for diagnosis and treatment.</p>
