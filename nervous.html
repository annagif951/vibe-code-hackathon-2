<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The nervous system is responsible for <strong>transmitting signals</strong> between different parts of the body. It regulates bodily functions, processes sensory input, and coordinates responses. It is essential for everything from basic reflexes to complex thought processes and emotions.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Communication:</strong> The nervous system enables rapid communication between cells, allowing the body to respond quickly to internal and external changes.</li>
    <li><strong>Integration:</strong> It integrates sensory information and coordinates appropriate responses.</li>
    <li><strong>Homeostasis:</strong> Works closely with the endocrine system to maintain stable internal conditions.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Divisions of the Nervous System</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Central Nervous System (CNS):</strong> Consists of the <strong>brain and spinal cord</strong>. Integrates and processes information. The CNS is protected by the skull, vertebral column, and cerebrospinal fluid.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Brain:</strong> The command center for the body, responsible for interpreting sensory information, generating thoughts and emotions, and controlling voluntary and involuntary actions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Spinal Cord:</strong> Acts as a conduit for signals between the brain and the rest of the body. It also coordinates many reflexes independently of the brain.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Peripheral Nervous System (PNS):</strong> Includes <strong>nerves outside the CNS</strong>. Carries signals between the CNS and the rest of the body. The PNS is further divided into the somatic and autonomic nervous systems.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Somatic Nervous System:</strong> Controls voluntary movements and transmits sensory information to the CNS.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Autonomic Nervous System:</strong> Regulates involuntary functions such as heart rate, digestion, and breathing. It is further divided into:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Sympathetic Nervous System:</strong> Prepares the body for stressful or emergency situations ("fight or flight").
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Parasympathetic Nervous System:</strong> Promotes relaxation and recovery ("rest and digest").
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Cranial and Spinal Nerves:</strong> The PNS includes 12 pairs of cranial nerves (arising from the brain) and 31 pairs of spinal nerves (arising from the spinal cord), which connect the CNS to limbs and organs.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Together, the CNS and PNS allow the body to sense the environment, process information, and respond appropriately, ensuring survival and adaptation.
    </p>

    <h2>Functional Classifications</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Somatic Nervous System:</strong> Controls <strong>voluntary movements</strong> via skeletal muscles. It also mediates reflex arcs. This system allows conscious control over actions such as walking, writing, and speaking. Sensory neurons in the somatic system relay information from the skin, muscles, and joints to the CNS.</li>
        <li><strong>Autonomic Nervous System:</strong> Regulates <strong>involuntary functions</strong> like heart rate, digestion, and respiratory rate. It operates subconsciously and is essential for maintaining homeostasis. The autonomic system also controls functions such as pupil dilation, sweating, and blood pressure.</li>
        <li><strong>Sympathetic Division:</strong> “Fight or flight” response—prepares the body for stress by increasing heart rate, dilating pupils, and redirecting blood flow to muscles. It also inhibits digestion and relaxes the airways to increase oxygen intake. The sympathetic division is activated during emergencies or intense physical activity.</li>
        <li><strong>Parasympathetic Division:</strong> “Rest and digest” response—maintains body balance by slowing the heart rate, stimulating digestion, and conserving energy. It promotes activities that occur when the body is at rest, such as salivation, urination, and energy storage.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        These functional classifications work together to ensure the body can respond appropriately to different situations, balancing energy use and recovery. Disruptions in these systems can lead to disorders such as hypertension, digestive problems, or abnormal stress responses.
    </p>

    <h2>Neurons & Neurotransmitters</h2>
    <p>The <strong>basic unit</strong> of the nervous system is the neuron. Neurons transmit electrical and chemical signals across synapses. Each neuron consists of a cell body, dendrites (receive signals), and an axon (sends signals). Neurons communicate with each other and with other cells through specialized connections called synapses, where neurotransmitters are released to propagate the signal.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sensory neurons:</strong> Carry signals <strong>from receptors to the CNS</strong>, allowing us to perceive stimuli like touch, sound, and light.</li>
        <li><strong>Motor neurons:</strong> Send signals <strong>from CNS to muscles and glands</strong>, enabling movement and secretion.</li>
        <li><strong>Interneurons:</strong> Facilitate communication <strong>within the CNS</strong>, processing information and coordinating responses. Interneurons are the most numerous type of neuron and are essential for reflexes and higher brain functions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Neurotransmitters play a key role in signal transmission:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Acetylcholine:</strong> Muscle activation, learning, and memory. It is the main neurotransmitter at neuromuscular junctions.</li>
        <li><strong>Dopamine:</strong> Mood regulation, reward processing, and motor control. Imbalances are linked to Parkinson’s disease and schizophrenia. Dopamine pathways are also involved in motivation and addiction.</li>
        <li><strong>Serotonin:</strong> Emotional balance, sleep, and appetite regulation. Low serotonin levels are associated with depression and anxiety disorders.</li>
        <li><strong>Glutamate:</strong> Primary excitatory neurotransmitter, crucial for learning and memory. Excess glutamate can cause excitotoxicity, leading to neuron damage.</li>
        <li><strong>GABA:</strong> Primary inhibitory neurotransmitter, helps reduce neuronal excitability and prevent overstimulation. GABA imbalances can contribute to anxiety and seizure disorders.</li>
        <li><strong>Norepinephrine:</strong> Involved in alertness, arousal, and the stress response. It prepares the body for action in stressful situations.</li>
        <li><strong>Endorphins:</strong> Natural painkillers produced by the body, also associated with feelings of pleasure and well-being.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Neurons require support from <strong>glial cells</strong>, which provide structural support, nutrition, insulation (myelin), and help maintain the environment around neurons. Examples include astrocytes, oligodendrocytes (CNS), and Schwann cells (PNS).</p>
    <p>Proper functioning of neurons and neurotransmitters is essential for all nervous system activities, from simple reflexes to complex cognitive processes.</p>

    <h2>Brain Structure & Functions</h2>
    <p>The brain is divided into several regions with distinct functions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cerebrum:</strong> Responsible for <strong>higher-order thinking, memory, voluntary movement, language, and sensory perception</strong>. Divided into lobes (frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital) with specialized roles.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Frontal Lobe:</strong> Controls reasoning, planning, problem-solving, emotions, and voluntary movement.</li>
                <li><strong>Parietal Lobe:</strong> Processes sensory information such as touch, temperature, and pain.</li>
                <li><strong>Temporal Lobe:</strong> Involved in auditory perception, language comprehension, and memory storage.</li>
                <li><strong>Occipital Lobe:</strong> Responsible for visual processing.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Cerebellum:</strong> Regulates <strong>balance, coordination, and motor control</strong>. Essential for smooth, coordinated movements. Also plays a role in motor learning and fine-tuning voluntary actions.</li>
        <li><strong>Brainstem:</strong> Controls <strong>automatic functions</strong> like breathing, heartbeat, and blood pressure. Connects the brain to the spinal cord.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Midbrain:</strong> Involved in vision, hearing, and motor control.</li>
                <li><strong>Pons:</strong> Relays signals between the cerebrum and cerebellum; involved in sleep and respiration.</li>
                <li><strong>Medulla Oblongata:</strong> Regulates vital functions such as heart rate, breathing, and swallowing.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Hypothalamus:</strong> Maintains <strong>homeostasis</strong>, including hunger, thirst, temperature regulation, and links the nervous system to the endocrine system via the pituitary gland. Also regulates circadian rhythms and emotional responses.</li>
        <li><strong>Limbic System:</strong> Involved in <strong>emotion, motivation, and memory</strong>. Includes structures like the amygdala (emotion processing), hippocampus (memory formation), and hypothalamus (emotional regulation).</li>
        <li><strong>Corpus Callosum:</strong> A thick band of nerve fibers that connects the left and right hemispheres of the cerebrum, allowing communication between them.</li>
        <li><strong>Ventricles:</strong> Fluid-filled cavities that produce and circulate cerebrospinal fluid, protecting and nourishing the brain.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each brain region works together to process information, control bodily functions, and enable complex behaviors. Damage to specific areas can result in characteristic deficits, highlighting the specialized roles of each structure.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Spinal Cord & Reflexes</h2>
    <p>The spinal cord acts as a <strong>communication highway</strong> between the brain and peripheral nerves. It is protected by vertebrae and surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Grey Matter:</strong> Contains <strong>neuron cell bodies</strong> for processing signals. It is shaped like a butterfly or the letter "H" in cross-section and is involved in integrating sensory and motor information.</li>
        <li><strong>White Matter:</strong> Consists of <strong>myelinated fibers</strong> for transmitting signals rapidly up and down the spinal cord. White matter is organized into tracts that carry information to and from the brain.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The spinal cord is divided into segments, each giving rise to a pair of spinal nerves that innervate specific regions of the body (dermatomes and myotomes). Damage to certain segments can result in loss of sensation or movement below the injury site.</p>
    <p>Reflexes occur <strong>without conscious control</strong>, ensuring rapid response to stimuli. Examples include the knee-jerk reflex and withdrawal from pain. Reflex arcs typically involve a sensory neuron, an interneuron in the spinal cord, and a motor neuron, allowing for quick reactions without brain involvement.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Monosynaptic Reflex:</strong> Involves a direct connection between sensory and motor neurons (e.g., patellar reflex).</li>
        <li><strong>Polysynaptic Reflex:</strong> Involves one or more interneurons (e.g., withdrawal reflex from a painful stimulus).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Reflex testing is an important part of neurological exams and can help diagnose nervous system disorders.</p>

    <h2>Common Nervous System Disorders</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Parkinson’s Disease:</strong> Degenerative disorder affecting movement due to dopamine deficiency. Symptoms include tremors, stiffness, and slow movement. It primarily affects older adults and can also cause balance problems, speech changes, and difficulty with writing. Treatment focuses on medications that increase dopamine levels and physical therapy.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Alzheimer’s Disease:</strong> Progressive memory loss and cognitive decline, often associated with abnormal protein deposits in the brain. Early symptoms include forgetfulness and confusion, progressing to severe memory impairment and loss of independence. Risk increases with age, and there is currently no cure, but medications and supportive care can help manage symptoms.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Multiple Sclerosis (MS):</strong> Autoimmune attack on the nervous system’s myelin sheath, leading to muscle weakness, vision problems, and impaired coordination. MS can cause numbness, fatigue, and problems with balance and walking. Symptoms often come and go in episodes (relapses), and treatment includes immunosuppressive drugs and rehabilitation.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Epilepsy:</strong> Neurological disorder characterized by repeated seizures due to abnormal electrical activity in the brain. Seizures can vary from brief lapses in attention to severe convulsions. Causes include genetics, brain injury, or unknown factors. Treatment usually involves anti-seizure medications and sometimes surgery.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Stroke:</strong> Occurs when blood flow to part of the brain is interrupted, causing brain cell death and loss of function. Symptoms may include sudden weakness, speech difficulties, vision loss, and paralysis on one side of the body. Immediate medical attention is critical. Risk factors include high blood pressure, smoking, and heart disease.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Migraines:</strong> Severe headaches often accompanied by nausea, sensitivity to light, and visual disturbances. Migraines can last from hours to days and may be triggered by stress, certain foods, or hormonal changes. Treatment includes pain relievers, preventive medications, and lifestyle modifications.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Peripheral Neuropathy:</strong> Damage to peripheral nerves causing weakness, numbness, and pain, usually in the hands and feet. Causes include diabetes, infections, and exposure to toxins. Management focuses on treating the underlying cause and relieving symptoms.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS):</strong> Progressive degeneration of motor neurons, leading to muscle weakness, paralysis, and eventually respiratory failure. ALS is also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease. There is no cure, but supportive care can improve quality of life.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Meningitis:</strong> Inflammation of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord, usually caused by infection. Symptoms include headache, fever, stiff neck, and sensitivity to light. Meningitis can be life-threatening and requires prompt treatment with antibiotics or antivirals.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for managing nervous system disorders. Regular check-ups, healthy lifestyle choices, and awareness of symptoms can help reduce risks and improve outcomes.
