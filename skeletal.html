            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The skeletal system consists of **206 bones** in an adult human body. It plays crucial roles in:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Providing **structural support** for the body.</li>
                <li>Protecting **vital organs**, like the brain, heart, and lungs.</li>
                <li>Facilitating **movement** via muscular attachments.</li>
                <li>Producing **blood cells** in bone marrow.</li>
                <li>Regulating **calcium and phosphate homeostasis**.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>Bone Classification</h2>
            <p>Bones are categorized based on their shape and function:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Long bones:</strong> Support movement (e.g., femur, humerus). Typically found in the limbs, they act as levers and are crucial for mobility.</li>
                <li><strong>Short bones:</strong> Stability and weight-bearing (e.g., carpals, tarsals). These bones are nearly equal in length and width, providing support with limited movement.</li>
                <li><strong>Flat bones:</strong> Protect organs and provide muscle attachment (e.g., skull, sternum). Their thin, flattened shape offers broad surfaces for muscle attachment and protection of internal organs.</li>
                <li><strong>Irregular bones:</strong> Complex shape for specialized functions (e.g., vertebrae, pelvis). Their unique shapes are adapted to specific functions, such as protecting the spinal cord or supporting body weight.</li>
                <li><strong>Sesamoid bones:</strong> Embedded within tendons (e.g., patella). These bones reduce friction and modify pressure, often improving the mechanical advantage of tendons.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each bone type plays a distinct role in the body's structure and function, contributing to overall mobility, protection, and support.</p>

            <h2>Major Components of the Skeletal System</h2>
            <p>The skeleton is divided into two main parts, each with distinct structures and functions:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Axial Skeleton:</strong> 
                <ul>
                <li>Composed of 80 bones, including the skull, vertebral column, and rib cage.</li>
                <li><strong>Skull:</strong> Protects the brain and forms the structure of the face.</li>
                <li><strong>Vertebral column:</strong> Consists of 33 vertebrae, supports the body, and protects the spinal cord.</li>
                <li><strong>Rib cage:</strong> Includes 12 pairs of ribs and the sternum, shielding the heart and lungs.</li>
                <li>Functions in <em>protection</em> of vital organs, <em>support</em> of the body's central axis, and <em>stability</em>.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Appendicular Skeleton:</strong>
                <ul>
                <li>Composed of 126 bones, including the limbs and the pectoral (shoulder) and pelvic (hip) girdles.</li>
                <li><strong>Pectoral girdle:</strong> Clavicles and scapulae anchor the upper limbs to the trunk.</li>
                <li><strong>Pelvic girdle:</strong> Hip bones connect the lower limbs to the spine and support body weight.</li>
                <li><strong>Limbs:</strong> Arms, forearms, hands, thighs, legs, and feet enable a wide range of movements.</li>
                <li>Enables <em>movement</em>, <em>manipulation</em> of the environment, and <em>flexibility</em>.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Together, the axial and appendicular skeletons provide the framework for the body, protect internal organs, and facilitate movement and interaction with the environment.</p>

            <h2>Bone Structure & Physiology</h2>
            <p>Bones are complex organs composed of various tissues and specialized cells, each contributing to their strength, flexibility, and function:</p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Compact bone (Cortical bone):</strong> Dense, strong outer layer that provides structural support and protection. Contains microscopic units called osteons or Haversian systems, which allow for nutrient delivery and waste removal.</li>
            <li><strong>Spongy bone (Cancellous bone):</strong> Porous, lightweight inner layer found mainly at the ends of long bones and inside flat bones. Contains trabeculae (lattice-like structures) that help absorb shock and distribute forces.</li>
            <li><strong>Periosteum:</strong> Tough, fibrous membrane covering the outer surface of bones (except at joints). Rich in blood vessels and nerves, it nourishes bone tissue and serves as an attachment point for tendons and ligaments.</li>
            <li><strong>Endosteum:</strong> Thin vascular membrane lining the inner surface of the bone, including the medullary cavity. Contains cells involved in bone growth, repair, and remodeling.</li>
            <li><strong>Bone marrow:</strong> 
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Red marrow:</strong> Found mainly in flat bones and the ends of long bones; responsible for producing red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets (hematopoiesis).</li>
                <li><strong>Yellow marrow:</strong> Located in the central cavities of long bones; primarily stores fat but can convert to red marrow if necessary (e.g., in cases of severe blood loss).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Articular cartilage:</strong> Smooth, white tissue covering the ends of bones at joints, reducing friction and absorbing shock during movement.</li>
            <li><strong>Bone cells:</strong> 
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Osteoblasts:</strong> Build new bone matrix.</li>
                <li><strong>Osteocytes:</strong> Mature bone cells that maintain bone tissue.</li>
                <li><strong>Osteoclasts:</strong> Break down and resorb bone matrix.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Together, these components enable bones to provide support, protect organs, facilitate movement, store minerals (like calcium and phosphorus), and produce blood cells.</p>

            <h2>Bone Development & Growth</h2>
            <p>Bone formation, or <strong>ossification</strong>, is a complex process that begins during fetal development and continues into early adulthood. There are two primary processes:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Endochondral Ossification:</strong> 
                <ul>
                <li>Most bones, especially long bones (like the femur and humerus), develop this way.</li>
                <li>Bone tissue gradually replaces a cartilage template, starting in the center (diaphysis) and progressing toward the ends (epiphyses).</li>
                <li>This process allows bones to grow in length at the <strong>epiphyseal (growth) plates</strong> until the plates close after puberty.</li>
                <li>Endochondral ossification begins with mesenchymal cells differentiating into chondrocytes, forming a cartilage model of the future bone. Blood vessels invade the cartilage, bringing osteoblasts that start forming bone tissue. The cartilage is progressively replaced by bone, except at the articular surfaces and growth plates.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Intramembranous Ossification:</strong>
                <ul>
                <li>Occurs mainly in flat bones, such as those of the skull, mandible, and clavicle.</li>
                <li>Bone develops directly from sheets of mesenchymal (undifferentiated) connective tissue without a cartilage stage.</li>
                <li>Responsible for the formation of cranial bones and contributes to the widening of bones.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            <strong>Bone Growth:</strong> 
            <ul>
                <li>Longitudinal growth occurs at the epiphyseal plates, where new cartilage is continuously produced and then replaced by bone tissue.</li>
                <li>Appositional growth increases bone diameter by adding new bone tissue to the outer surface (periosteum).</li>
                <li>Growth is regulated by hormones such as growth hormone, thyroid hormone, and sex hormones (estrogen and testosterone).</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
            <strong>Bone Remodeling:</strong> 
            <ul>
                <li>Throughout life, bones are constantly renewed and reshaped through the coordinated actions of osteoblasts (bone-building cells) and osteoclasts (bone-resorbing cells).</li>
                <li>This process helps repair micro-damage, adapt to stress, and regulate calcium levels in the body.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
            <strong>Clinical Note:</strong> Disorders in bone development and growth can lead to conditions such as dwarfism, gigantism, and growth plate injuries in children.

            <h2>Joints & Movement</h2>
            <p>Joints allow movement and are classified as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fibrous joints:</strong> Immovable (e.g., skull sutures).</li>
                <li><strong>Cartilaginous joints:</strong> Partially movable (e.g., vertebrae).</li>
                <li><strong>Synovial joints:</strong> Freely movable (e.g., knee, shoulder).</li>
            </ul>

                <li><strong>Osteoclasts:</strong> Break down and resorb old bone.</li>
                <li><strong>Calcium homeostasis:</strong> Maintained by hormones like parathyroid hormone and calcitonin.</li>
            </ul>
